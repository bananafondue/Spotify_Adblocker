Go to https://developer.spotify.com/, create an app, give it any name and description.
Once created, click edit settings and set the "redirect URIs" to https://google.com

Go to dashboard and copy the "client id" and "client secret" and save it somewhere.

Now we need to base64 encode <client id:client secret> with the semicolon included(and without the <>).
To get this encoded string, go to https://www.base64encode.org/.

(for eg: if your client id is xyz and client secret is abc, then you need to encode xyz:abc)

#Replace {} with client id here

https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=cec22c821e4944d79726c52513e9b57c
&scopes=user-read-currently-playing&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com

                                
Copy and paste the url above in a browser. It will open a page where you approve your application to access the currently-played-track.
Once you accept, it will redirect you to "google.com/code=xxxx". Copy this code and save it somewhere.

Now, In the curl command given below,
#Replace the first {} with the encoded string 
#Replace the second {} with the code received

curl -H "Authorization: Basic {}"
 -d grant_type=authorization_code -d 
code={} -d
 redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token

Copy this curl command as a whole and paste it in the command prompt. If everything checks out, it will return some data.
This will contain the "refresh token" string that you need, so save it.

So now for the secrets.py file, you will have 
spotify_user_id --> from the accounts page(not the same as client id)
refresh_token --> obtained above
base_64 --> the encoded string
